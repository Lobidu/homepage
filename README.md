# Homepage

> Janis' private homepage project, built entirely with vue.js, bulma and nothing else.

## Structure

The structure is composed of .vue Component files
- App.vue contains the router view
- The only available view so far is HelloWorld, which displays the main Single page, composed of the display components

vue-router is currently not used, but set up in case I'd like to add some deeplinking later. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
